## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase the practical implementation of Elastic Cloud in a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. It includes:

- Account creation on Elastic cloud
- Setting up Elastic cloud for monitoring purposes
- Demonstration of monitoring event using a sample malicious script
- Analysis of events and potential threats

## Usage Instructions

To replicate the steps demonstrated in the video:

1. **Account Creation:** Follow the instructions provided in the video to create an account on Cloud.

2. **Setup:** Configure Cloud according to the specifications outlined in the video for monitoring purposes.

3. **Monitoring Demo:** Execute the provided malicious script to generate simulated security events. Use Cloud to monitor and analyze these events.

   (**Note:** The provided malicious script is for demonstration purposes only and should be executed in a secure environment. Do not run it on your main computer or network.)

4. **Analysis:** Analyze the events collected by Cloud to identify potential security threats and take appropriate actions.
